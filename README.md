## My process

start with the skeleton of the design thinking in mobile first, then i just insert the card skeleton in a section and set the size in the section. After more delete repeat process i get satisfied with my mobile version while i was testing for desktop option i just realize i only have to set a min-max width and heigh for make the design responsive, i realize after finish the project i can use grid for make make the card more smooth while i changing the screen size i will try it in next projects!.
